            <p>
                I am by no means a professional pianist like Jon Schmidt and Marshall McDonald, but I still want to share some of my pieces and arrangements.
                I first learned to play the piano from my siblings, and I learned by watching them, not reading sheet music.  It wasn't until late in my high school years that
                I started to fully understand sheet music, and I started composing my own music around that time.

                    This song does not have a name, as I can't find a title that I feel represents it well.  Once when I was trying to actually write sheet music for this
                    song, I used the title 'Lake,' but I have don't particularly like this title.  I wrote this song while serving in the Arkansas Bentonville Mission

                    This song also does not have a title, and I also composed this on my mission.  The tune kind of popped into my head, and I quickly worked it out on the piano.
                    I really like the happy and nostalgic feeling from this song.

                    This song is an original arrangement of the hymns "Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing" and "Be Thou My Vision."  I love the melodies of these songs,
                    and when written in the same key, they flow in and out of each other well.  I originally arranged them separately, and then combined them spontaneously
                    after noticing how the melodies fit well with each other.
